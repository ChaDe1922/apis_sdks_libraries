Note: You can use Jupyter Notebooks or a normal `.py` file - whichever you prefer. If you use a `.py` file, you can run it by typing `python3 filename.py` into the terminal and pressing Enter/Return (where `filename` is the name of your file).

In the next lesson, you'll learn how to parse the JSON that gets returned from a GET request. In the mean time:

1. Install the library corresponding to the API you have chosen. Generally the command should look something like `pip3 install library_name`

### Permissions Error?
If you are trying to install a library and get a permissions error, put `sudo` at the beginning of the command. Example: `sudo pip3 install library_name`

2. Get the authentication setup for the API you have chosen

3. Test the API by sending a POST request

If the API has no POST requests, feel free to use a GET request and just print out the JSON so you can confirm you are successful.

There is a collapse button in the top-left corner of this panel that will minimize these instructions so you have more space to work on your code.
